    abstract = { There has been considerable interest in computer viruses since they first appeared in 1981, and especially in the past few years as they have reached epidemic numbers in many personal computer environments. Viruses have been written about as a security problem, as a social problem, and as a possible means of performing useful tasks in a distributed computing environment. However, only recently have some scientists begun to ask if computer viruses are not a form of artificial life—a self-replicating organism. Simply because computer viruses do not exist as organic molecules may not be sufficient reason to dismiss the classification of this form of “vandalware” as a form of life. This paper begins with a description of how computer viruses operate and their history, and of the various ways computer viruses are structured. It then examines how viruses meet properties associated with life as defined by some researchers in the area of artificial life and self-organizing systems. The paper concludes with some comments directed toward the definition of artificially “alive” systems and experimentation. }

abstract="Simulation is a standard technique to understand or to analyze complex Discrete Event Systems (DES). Distributed simulation techniques try to improve the elapsed time of sequential simulations for large DES models by dividing a monolithic simulation application into communicating concurrent Logical Processes. The performance of the simulator is usually evaluated on the basis of the time needed and the involved resources to complete a simulation run. Additionally, cloud computing, under a pay-per-use model, introduces the costs of the resources that must be allocated to run the simulation. In this paper, a Petri Net based modeling methodology for complex systems is presented producing hierarchical and modular models. From this model, an elaboration process produces a heterarchical model for efficient execution of the simulation over cloud platforms using well known techniques. The required partitioning of the model may be subject to different criteria such as cost, elapsed time, and synchronization constraints, where the structural properties of the Petri Nets can aid in this task.",
